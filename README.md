# FakeItTillYouMakeIt
Fake It Till You Make is a fictional rental site that offers rental homes, vehicles, and clothing for individuals that dream of 
becoming a millinaire but don't have the time or ability to put in the work.
# About Us
We are 2009 Ford F-350 Platinum Extended Cab Dully Edition 6.4 L V8 Diesel (White). Our team consists of
the team manager, Vraj Patel, and team members Jack Finney and Harsh Patel. The idea for our fictional bussiness came from
Harsh Patel, who recalled a video he had seen on YouTube about people who faked being rich.
